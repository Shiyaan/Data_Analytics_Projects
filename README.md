    <h1>Impact of Digitalization on Entrepreneurship</h1>
Research Summary: Impact of Digitalization on Global Entrepreneurship
Overview
This study investigates how digitalization affects entrepreneurship worldwide using machine learning techniques, analyzing data from 123 countries between 2000-2023.
Key Objectives

Identify which digitalization factors most impact entrepreneurship
Apply machine learning to predict entrepreneurial outcomes
Create visual tools for policymakers and stakeholders

Methodology
Data Sources:

Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) - entrepreneurship data
World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) - digital and economic metrics

Approach:

Created three digital indices using Principal Component Analysis: Digital Infrastructure, Digital Finance, and Digital Innovation
Applied four ML models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM
Used clustering analysis (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN) to group countries

Major Findings
Digital Infrastructure is the strongest predictor of entrepreneurship, followed by Digital Finance. Digital Innovation showed surprisingly weak correlation.
Best ML Model: XGBoost achieved highest accuracy (RÂ² = 0.517, RMSE = 0.359)
Country Clusters: Four distinct groups emerged:

High digital finance countries with strong entrepreneurship
Low digital readiness with weak entrepreneurship
High infrastructure leaders
Innovation-focused but limited entrepreneurial impact

Supporting Evidence: Canonical Correlation Analysis showed strong relationships (>0.8) between digitalization and entrepreneurship indicators.
Implications
Policymakers should prioritize investment in digital infrastructure and financial access to foster entrepreneurship. The research includes an interactive Power BI dashboard for practical application.
Limitations
Data inconsistency across countries and inability to capture qualitative factors like cultural attitudes toward entrepreneurship.
